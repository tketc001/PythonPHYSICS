    "This is a follow up to Homework 7a. You may now be convinced that the random (drunkard's) walk is really a model for diffusion. In other words, it is a microscopic description of the physics that led to the diffusion equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inconsequential Remark**: Here's a deep thought (that's actually a *deep* idea in theoretical physics): the fact that this is a microscopic description that leads to the macroscopic physics of the diffusion equation does not mean that any actual physical system obeying the diffusion equation is described microscopically by a random walk. However, because it maps onto the same macroscopic physics, it doesn't really matter. This is a really heuristic way of describing a program that has come to be known as [renormalization](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/renormalization.html).\n",

    "This homework examines what happens when one drop of cream falls into a cup of coffee. To aid in plotting, we work in 2 dimensions. The drop is modeled as $N$ cream molecules that start at the origin of a lattice. The molecules are non-interacting and behave as two-dimensional drunkards: at each time step they move randomly. For simplicity, let them move one unit---up, down, left, or right---each time step."

To determine the probability of being in, say, the top left corner microstate, $i = (-4,4)$, then we simply count how many of the 400 cream molecules were in that corner and divide by the total number of cream molecules. \n",
